# RDataViz
Examples of data viz using R with an emphasis on good practice in visual design.

All examples assume that R Studio is being used.

## Data viz: general tips

### Suppress scientific notation

Often it is useful to suppress scientific notation.  To do so use the following code in your R script prior to plotting:

```r
options(scipen=999) # supress scientific notation
```

### Commas in scales


### Working with colour

#### Getting a range of colours

A quick method to get a range of colours:

```r
colfunc <- colorRampPalette(c("#8E0A26", "white")) # Create colour gradient between two colours
colfunc(6) # print 6 colours in the range
colfunc(20) # print 20 colours in the range
```

#### Defining colour scales


##### Continuous scales


##### Discrete scales


#### Colour blind safe colours

The ggthemes library provides good colour blind friendly palletes based on those provided by Tableau.  To view this pallete use:

```r
library("scales")
show_col(tableau_color_pal('colorblind10')(10))
```

To use in your plots, add the following line as part of your ggplot:

```r
scale_colour_tableau(name = "","colorblind10") # use Tableau colour blind pallete
```
