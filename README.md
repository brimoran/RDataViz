# RDataViz
Examples of data viz using R with an emphasis on good practice in visual design.

All examples assume that R Studio is being used.

All examples are cobbled together from the work of others found on the web.  I'll try to attribute the source of code used but let me know if I miss this. 

#Tips

##Suppress scientific notation

```r
options(scipen=999) # supress scientific notation
```

## Working with colour

```r
# Get colours based on corporate colour

colfunc <- colorRampPalette(c("#8E0A26", "white")) # Create colour palette between two colours
colfunc(20) # print 20 colours in the range

```
